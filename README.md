# Drunkard
Drunkard is a local variation of well-known [card game War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_%28card_game%29).

If you look at the source code, most likely you'll find it pretty weird. That's because this project is being built according to the rules of [Object Calisthenics challenge](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/luontola/tdd-2009/ext/ObjectCalisthenics.pdf).

The rules are as follows:
- One level of indentation per method
- Don’t use the ELSE keyword 
- Wrap all primitives and Strings
- First class collections
- One dot per line
- Don’t abbreviate
- Keep all entities small
- No classes with more than two instance variables
- No getters/setters/properties
